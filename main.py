"""
* Police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops per day in the United States (_From the ‚ÄúStanford Open Policing Project‚Äù_)
* The consequence of that violation depends on the punishment that the officer gives to the driver
* Factors from drivers that lead to traffic violations
    * lacking knowledge or experience
    * driver‚Äôs demographic
    * Type of violation and the number of violations they have made
* The same traffic violation might result in different punishments which depend upon the **police‚Äôs judgment**
* This study aims to find relations between :orange[**officers‚Äô demographic and driver factors that relate to punishment in traffic stops**]
