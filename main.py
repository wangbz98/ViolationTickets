"""
* Police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops per day in the United States (_From the ‚ÄúStanford Open Policing Project‚Äù_)
* The consequence of that violation depends on the punishment that the officer gives to the driver
* Factors from drivers that lead to traffic violations
    * lacking knowledge or experience
    * driver‚Äôs demographic
    * Type of violation and the number of violations they have made
* The same traffic violation might result in different punishments which depend upon the **police‚Äôs judgment**
* This study aims to find relations between :orange[**officers‚Äô demographic and driver factors that relate to punishment in traffic stops**]

# Conclusion

"""
Different officials tend to make different decisions. According to Figure 1 and observing the curves, the light blue curves representing violations decrease at "Black M" and "Asian F" respectively, and the yellow curves represent that Gender is low at the beginning, but starts to rise at "Asian M" and then at "White F" , and the blue curve representing intercept and the light blue curve representing violation start to rise all the way at "Hispanic F". Thus, we can draw the following conclusions:
"""
)

st.markdown(
"""
1)  Asian female officials are the fairest female officer group compared to the others, as all coefficient lines drop significantly at "Asian F", meaning that all attributes are less correlated there.\n
2)  Drivers are less relevant to their movements with Black male officers than with White male officers.\n
3)	Asian, Hispanic and other male officers more likely to file tickets based on driver's gender.\n
4)	Due to the lack of data, the coefficient values are unreasonable for Hispanic female officers and other female officer groups.
"""

)

st.markdown(
"""
Combining with Figure 2, we can see that the P values of other groups except white police officers are very high. From this, it can be concluded that the data volume of other groups is small, and the results have large errors and have little reference significance. However, we can still draw some useful conclusions from Figure 2.
